# Does Sound Affect Mario Kart Performance?
Experiemental Design 

This project performs an analysis of variance (ANOVA) experiment evaluating whether game sound effects influence player performance in Mario Kart 8. Participants raced under different conditions varying sound, difficulty level, and number of players.

## The analysis focuses on:

-- Checking model assumptions like normality and constant variance

-- Interpreting the ANOVA table and significance of effects

-- Exploring possible interactions between factors

 The full statistical analysis and R code for plots and models is contained in the experimental_design.html file.

## Key findings:

-- Sound did not have a significant main effect on race times

-- Difficulty level did significantly affect performance as expected

-- Interactions between sound, difficulty, and players were likely obscured by error

-- While not definitive, this initial experiment provides a framework for further studies on how sound impacts Mario Kart player performance.
